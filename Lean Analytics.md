Instincts are experiments -> Data is proof

Define what success looks like beforehand, and know what youâ€™re going to do if your hunch is right.

Basic numbers
- where money comes from 
- how much things cost
- how many customers you have 
- effectiveness of your customer acquisition strategies

Accounting metrics: How are you doing in respect with your plans.

Experimental metrics: results of tests, allows to change behaviour.

Examples:
- Conversion rate
- Time to purchase
- Viral coefficient
- Viral cycle time

**Quali**
Imprecise/subjective/can't be track in time. You are able to get insights if you do it correctly.

Real metrics:
They are acctionable, you have to change behaviour if there is a drift.

Exploratory metrics:
- Try to figure out the unknown unknown.
- Can be used to test intuitions with tests.

Reporting metrics: Check the facts and assumptions


Segmentation/Cohort/A|B and multivariable.	


Frameworks
----------

Problem | Customer Segments | Value proposition | Solution | Natural Channels | Revenue Strem | Cost Structure | Formal channels | Unfair advantage (Lean canvas)

Adquisition -> Activation -> Retention -> Revenue -> Referral  (ARR)

Sticky | Virality | Paid (Monetization and inversion in lead generation)  (Engines of growth)

Market fit -> Unfair Advantage -> Spread to new markets/products/audiences  (Growth Pyramid)

Problem validation | Solution validation | MVP Building | MVP Iteration-Sticky engine | Organiz growth | Monetization | Inorganic growth (Lean startup)

Empathy -> Stickiness -> Virality -> Revenue -> Scale (Lean analytics stage)


Stickyness
----------

MVP is a process not a product: Iterations are methodical evolutions, targeting the improvement of the core metric(s)

Building a feature
- Why will it make things better -> hipothesis -> test (Improve X by Y)
- Measure the effect of the feature, otherwise scope creep and feature bloat
- How long will it take?
- Will things overcomplicate?
- How innovative is?
- Keep features aligned with the long term vision.

Two companies, one developing, another studying the customer. 


Scale
-----

Hole in the middle, can't be a niche player because it is too big, but cannot compete with big guys because lack of scale.

Different set of metrics used, upselling is the way.
